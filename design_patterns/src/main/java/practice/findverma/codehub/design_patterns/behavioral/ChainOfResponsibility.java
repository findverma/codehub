  		CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY
  	................................................................
  	Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design 
  	where a request from client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. 
  	Then the object in the chain will decide who will be processing the request 
  	and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.
  	
  	For Example:
  		Filter chaining
  		Intercepter chaining
  		Processor chaining
  		LOG Handler chaining 
  		Event Delegation Process etc.
