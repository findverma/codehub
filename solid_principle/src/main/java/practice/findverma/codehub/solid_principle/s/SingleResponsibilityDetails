	
	SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
	
	..............................................................................
	
	- A software entities (class , method) should have only one reason to change.
	- If a class or a method does more than one procedure, 
		it is recommended to separate it into distinct classes or methods
	- It can be done easily done with the help of interfaces.
	
	So if we have more than one reason to change for a class 
		we should split the functionality into two separate classes as 
			"EACH CLASS WILL HANDLE A SINGLE RESPONSIBLITY !!!"
			
			- It leads to a low coupled desing with less or lighter dependencies.
